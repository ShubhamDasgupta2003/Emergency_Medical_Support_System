          About Crocin Pain Relief Tablet 15's
          Crocin Pain Relief Tablet 15's is a combination medication, which belongs to the class of analgesic medication. It is primarily used to treat mild to moderate pain, including headache, backache, migraine, rheumatic and muscle pain, toothache and period pain. On the other hand, it also relieves discomfort in colds, influenza, and sore throats and helps reduce temperature. Pain is caused by the activation of pain receptors due to the release of certain chemicals or enzymes.
          
          Crocin Pain Relief Tablet 15's contains paracetamol and caffeine. Paracetamol inhibits the release of these enzymes and alleviates pain. Caffeine increases the efficacy of paracetamol by improving its absorption, thereby prolonging analgesic action.
